# Krabot-Ground-Drone-six-legged-bot-Nuclear-Hazardous-Bot
The main focus of this project is to understand and implement the core concepts of robot modelling. Robot modelling consists of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics and trajectory planning to avoid collisions for the robot and the manipulator arm. For this scope of this project the equations of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics are manually calculated for a 6-DOF manipulator arm (arm of the Krabot). Additionally a robot model is designed in Solidworks and simulation of the equations are performed in ROS and Gazebo environment. We have designed a bio-inspired robot (Krabot) to pick objects, place the same objects on a dumpster and move swiftly avoiding collisions with the obstacles.
